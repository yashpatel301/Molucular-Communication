Accuracy_vs_epoch.ipynb and BER_vs_SNR_using_ANN_and_LSTM.ipynb are for the same use i.e. to get BER vs SNR but the difference is of datasets.
</br> In Accuracy_vs_epoch.ipynb we tried with the dataset we had generated in DataGeneration.m but here BER vs SNR plot is left.  
</br> In BER_vs_SNR_using_ANN_and_LSTM.ipynb we got the SNR vs BER plot but with the dataset that has been uploaded in Dataset folder.
