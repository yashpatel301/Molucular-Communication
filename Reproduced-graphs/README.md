Mapping of all graphs: some of them are reproduced from base article and rest are reproduced from the ANN and LSTM model 
</br> 1) Approximated_Distributions: this graphs shows the probability distribution of received information particles.
</br> 2) Optimal_zero_bit: This graph shows the BER as a function of Tau i.e. what should be the threshold for perticular delta T (time slot).
</br> 3) Optimal_vs_conventional_zero_bit: This graph shows the comparision w.r.t BER vs SNR, between optimally setting threshold and data driven model for threshold.
