## **Mapping of all graphs: some of them are reproduced from base article and rest are reproduced from the ANN and LSTM model:**  
</br> **1) Approximated_Distributions:** this graphs shows the probability distribution of received information particles.
</br> **2) Optimal_zero_bit:** This graph shows the BER as a function of Tau i.e. what should be the threshold for perticular delta T (time slot).
</br> **3) Optimal_vs_conventional_zero_bit:** This graph shows the comparision w.r.t BER vs SNR, between optimally setting threshold and data driven model for threshold.
</br> **4) ANN_Accuracy_Loss:** This graph is showing accuracy of ANN model after each epoch.
</br> **5) LSTM_Accuracy_Loss:** This graph is showing accuracy of LSTM model after each epoch.
</br> **6) ANN_SNRvsAccuracy:** This graphs shows the accuracy of ANN model at each SNR.
</br> **7) LSTM_SNRvsAccuracy:** This graph shows the accuracy of LSTM model at each SNR.
